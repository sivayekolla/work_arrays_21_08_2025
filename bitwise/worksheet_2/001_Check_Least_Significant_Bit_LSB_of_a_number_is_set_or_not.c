Check Least Significant Bit (LSB) of a number is set or not
Question: Write a C program to check if the Least Significant Bit (LSB) 
of a number is set (1) or not.

Sample data: 
Input: 5 (binary 0101)
Expected output: LSB of 5 is set (1)

    // (a >> 0) & 1 â†’ shifts number by 0
    // then AND with 1 extracts only the LSB.
